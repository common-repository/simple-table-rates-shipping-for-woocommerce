### Features
#### Handling Fees
If you need to add a handling fee for your shipping order, we set an option for that where you can add an amount of value to increase the shipping cost. The value can be either a number or a percentage.

#### Condition Types
* **Weight** Set shipping cost based on the total weight of the cartâ€™s items.
* **Cart Total** Add shipping costs based on the total cart amount.
* **Products** You can set the shipping cost for one or many products.
* **Quantity** Shipping is based on the total quantities of the items in the cart.
* **Volume** Shipping is based on the total volume of all items in the cart.

#### Hide Other Methods
You can hide other shipping methods if one of the table rates is available.

#### Duplicate Rules
For easier data entry, you can duplicate any rule.
